<p>Scorched 3D is a turn-based 3D artillery game inspired by the old MS-DOS cult classic Scorched Earth. The game was first released in 2001. The gameplay is simple but addictive. At the start of each round, the player and AI-controlled batteries and tanks are located on a 3d Island. Each player is tasked to destroy the other player by controlling the altitude, direction and power of their turret towards the enemy battery or their tank. Players can earn in-game currency by destroying enemy targets which they can use to buy special weapons, shields and upgrades at the end of each round. There is a wide variety of special weapons available including nukes which make the game a lot of fun. The game can also be played multiplayer online.</p>
<p>The default gameplay adheres to the formula of the old MS-DOS classic Scorched Earth but there are other game modes available as well the game can be modded and there is a variety of community-based modes available which can be downloaded.</p>
