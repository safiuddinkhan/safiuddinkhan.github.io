<p>First and for most for disclaimer this list is mine and these are the top 5 FOSS Linux games I like.</p>
<h2 id="0-ad">0 A.D.</h2>

<a href='/0ad.jpg'><img src='/0ad.jpg' alt='0 A.D. is a historic RTS game inspired by Age of Empires series' width='640px' height='' class="img-fluid pt-2 pb-2"></a>


<p>Of course, the first one on my list is 0AD. It is one of the best open-source games out there. It started its life as a mod for Age of Empires but has since become its own thing and runs on its own Pyrogenesis game engine. It focuses on the era between 500 BC — 1 BC.</p>
<p>You can download 0 A.D. from here <a href="https://play0ad.com/">https://play0ad.com/</a></p>
<h2 id="open-ra">Open RA</h2>

<a href='/openra.jpg'><img src='/openra.jpg' alt='OpenRA is a game engine recreation of the classic Red Alert game series from the 90s' width='640px' height='' class="img-fluid pt-2 pb-2"></a>


<p>Open RA is a game engine recreation of the classic Red Alert, Dune 2000 and Red Alert Tiberian Dawn games. It is pretty much the same fun as expected from those classic games but enhanced for the modern systems. The game engine is open-source, but it does require original game data though thankfully it automatically downloads the game data from their freeware versions automatically if nothing provided.</p>
<p>You can download OpenRA from here <a href="https://www.openra.net/">https://www.openra.net/</a></p>
<h2 id="supertux-kart">SuperTux Kart</h2>

<a href='/stk2.jpg'><img src='/stk2.jpg' alt='SuperTux Kart is a great kart racing game inspired from the classic Super Mario Kart game series' width='640px' height='' class="img-fluid pt-2 pb-2"></a>


<p>SuperTux Kart is a Kart racing game inspired by the classic Super Mario Kart but with free and open-source software mascots. It’s an extremely addictive and fun game and is a thing of its own. It also has several other game modes including a one called Soccer which is a mix between a kart racing game and Rocket League.</p>
<p>The game could be downloaded from here <a href="https://supertuxkart.net/">https://supertuxkart.net/</a></p>
<h2 id="c-dogs">C-Dogs</h2>

<a href='/cdogs.jpg'><img src='/cdogs.jpg' alt='C-Dogs is a great MOBA like shoot ’em up deathmatch game' width='640px' height='' class="img-fluid pt-2 pb-2"></a>


<p>C-Dogs is one of those games which had existed for a long time since the days of MS-DOS and I have only discovered it recently. It kind of behaves like modern MOBA games. It is a shoot ’em up video game in which you have to kill your enemies or each other in a deathmatch which could single player or it could be cooperative.</p>
<p>You can get more information about downloading the game from here <a href="https://github.com/cxong/cdogs-sdl">https://github.com/cxong/cdogs-sdl</a></p>
<h2 id="vcmi">VCMI</h2>

<a href='/homm3.jpg'><img src='/homm3.jpg' alt='CMI is a game engine recreation of the classic Heroes of Might and Magic III from 1999' width='640px' height='' class="img-fluid pt-2 pb-2"></a>


<p>VCMI is a game engine recreation of the classic Heroes of Might and Magic III from 1999. The game is a turn-based strategy game but on steroids set in the Might and Magic world. The game is so deep that you got to play it to believe it. The game is still very popular and has a cult following. VCMI needs original game data but if that is not available VCMI use game data from the shareware version of Heroes of Might and Magic III.</p>
<p>You can download VCMI project from <a href="https://vcmi.eu/">https://vcmi.eu/</a></p>
