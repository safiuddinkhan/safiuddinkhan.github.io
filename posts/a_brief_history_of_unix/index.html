<h2 id="what-is-unix">What is Unix?</h2>
<p>Unix is a family of operating systems whose origins go back to the Research Unix operating systems of the AT&amp;T Bell Labs from the early 1970s.</p>
<h2 id="the-beginnings">The Beginnings</h2>

<a href='/unix2.jpg'><img src='/unix2.jpg' alt='The PDP-11 mini computer on which the first edition of Unix was released.' width='640px' height='' class="img-fluid pt-2 pb-2"></a>


<p>To begin with, Unix is old, way old. Its origins go back to the 1960s to the days of mainframe computers. In the 1960s, MIT, along with General Electric, AT&amp;T and later Honeywell, collaborated on an early time-sharing operating system called Multics, which stood for Multiplexed Information and Computing Service. While it was an ambitious project of its time but it was not a success. Two of its developers, Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at AT&amp;T Bell Labs, saw the main problem of Multics as being too over complicated. They sought to develop their operating system to remedy the issues they saw in Multics and named it Unics and later Unix based on their idea of Keep it Simple Stupid. Yes, the name Unix is a pun on Multics.</p>
<p>The first edition of Research Unix got released in 1971. It ran on the DEC’s PDP-11 minicomputer. Because of AT&amp;T’s legal trouble, they could not sell Unix as a commercial product, so they more or less gave it away for a very relaxed non-commercial licence to research institutes and universities. It led to the rise of the popularity of Unix very quickly in academia.</p>
<p>P.S By the way Multics still exists if you wanna check it out as a curiosity follow this link:- <a href="https://www.multicians.org/">https://www.multicians.org/</a></p>
<h2 id="the-beginnings-of-the-bsd-unix-line">The beginnings of the BSD Unix line</h2>

<a href='/unix3.jpg'><img src='/unix3.jpg' alt='Bill Joy the founder of Sun Microsystems.' width='320px' height='' class="img-fluid pt-2 pb-2"></a>


<p>One of the earliest distributions of Unix was developed at Berkley University and was called Berkeley Software Distribution. Among the prominent people who worked on early BSD was a computer engineer named Bill Joy. Bill Joy is most famously known as the original creator of Vi Text Editor and the founder of Sun Microsystems. BSD distribution would live on and become completely open source in the 1990s as 386BSD. Though initially, 386BSD suffered from legal issues, which got resolved and all closed source code was removed.</p>
<p>Most modern BSD operating systems are descendants of 386 BSD and another branch called 4.3 BSD.</p>
<h2 id="unix-system-v-and-the-rise-of-commercial-unix-operating-systems">UNIX System V and the rise of commercial Unix Operating Systems</h2>

<a href='/unix4.jpg'><img src='/unix4.jpg' alt='A Unix 9000 Workstation.' width='640px' height='' class="img-fluid pt-2 pb-2"></a>


<p>By 1983 AT&amp;T was now a much smaller company thanks to the 1982 Antitrust lawsuit and was forced to give up most of its telecommunication business to smaller regional bell companies. So AT&amp;T worked out to develop market one of the first commercial versions of Unix called UNIX System III. Many commercial Unix operating systems of the 1980s were descendants of Unix System III. Later on, AT&amp;T and Sun Microsystems collaborated to produce SVR4 in 1988, which incorporated both the features of SVR3 and BSD Unix. It was a milestone, and most commercial Unix Operating Systems switched to SVR4.</p>
<h2 id="microsoft-and-its-distribution-of-unix">Microsoft and its distribution of Unix</h2>

<a href='/unix5.jpg'><img src='/unix5.jpg' alt='Microsoft Xenix Version 3.' width='640px' height='' class="img-fluid pt-2 pb-2"></a>


<p>Yes, Microsoft was into this market as well. Its version of Unix was called Xenix. It was initially a derivative of Research Unix 7 though later ones were derivatives of Unix System III and UnixVR2. Among its features was that it was 16-bit and meant for IBM PCs and clones and it had limited connectivity except for the serial port.</p>
<p>Microsoft marketed their product throughout the 1980s, but eventually, after the rise of Unix V, Microsoft thought it could not compete in the market and abandoned the operating system first in favour of OS/2 and later on their on Windows NT. Microsoft eventually sold Xenix to one of its distributors called SCO, and Xenix eventually evolved into SCO OpenServer.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, AT&amp;T sold Unix System V to Novell and quite the Unix market altogether. Unix System V eventually became Novell UnixWare but Novell also quite the Unix market and sold UnixWare to SCO.</p>
<h2 id="the-rise-of-open-source-movements">The rise of open-source movements</h2>

<a href='/unix6.jpg'><img src='/unix6.jpg' alt='Richard Stallman the founder of GNU Project.' width='640px' height='' class="img-fluid pt-2 pb-2"></a>


<p>In the 1980s, there was an entire hacking culture in the universities surrounding the Unix operating system and the free distribution of code. But that culture completely eroded after the rise of commercial Unix operating systems, which led to the foundation of several open-source movements. One of the most prominent of these movements was the GNU Project, led by Richard Stallman from MIT.</p>
<h2 id="the-rise-of-the-open-source-unix-like-operating-systems">The rise of the open-source Unix-like operating systems</h2>

<a href='/unix7.jpg'><img src='/unix7.jpg' alt='Linus Torvalds the creator of Linux Kernel.' width='320px' height='' class="img-fluid pt-2 pb-2"></a>


<p>By the early 90s, GNU Project reached almost all of its goals of creating a free and open-source alternative to commercial Unix operating systems though they still lacked a kernel. Meanwhile, a Finish software developer named Linus Torvalds developed his own open-source Unix-like operating system called Linux. Linux had its influence from another academic Unix-like operating system called Minix.
Linux was more or less only a kernel, so to fill the gap for user-land utilities, Linus Torvalds used the GNU utilities and the GCC compiler and thus GNU/Linux was born.</p>

<a href='/unix8.jpg'><img src='/unix8.jpg' alt='386BSD the first major opensource BSD OS.' width='640px' height='' class="img-fluid pt-2 pb-2"></a>


<p>Meanwhile, on the other side, the Computer Systems Research Group of Berkley University had a bleak future because of the lack of funds and was shutting down. So to secure the future of BSD distributions, it was decided by its developers to open source it. But they soon faced a lawsuit since BSD operating systems still contained the original Unix code from the 1980s. By 1994, the case against the BSD had been settled and most of the closed-source code was removed hence the modern BSD operating systems were born.</p>
<h2 id="the-demise-of-the-unix-workstation-market">The demise of the Unix workstation market</h2>

<a href='/unix9.jpg'><img src='/unix9.jpg' alt='A Sun SPARC workstation from the early 90s.' width='640px' height='' class="img-fluid pt-2 pb-2"></a>


<p>By mid 1990s, The technology had advanced enough that there was not much a need of any specialized computers with proprietary Unix operating systems. Now anyone can use a generic Pentium based computer with the open-source operating systems like Linux and the BSDs for the same purpose hence one by one the Unix workstation market started to collapse. One by one they all fall apart the last one of the last ones being the Sun Microsystems which was sold off to Oracle in 2010.</p>
<h2 id="the-survivors">The survivors</h2>
<p>Presently, There are only few proprietary Unix operating systems which exist. Among them are IMB’s AIX, HP-UX, Oracle’s Solaris and the modern Mac OS which was derived from Steve Job’s NeXTSTEP.</p>
<p>The open-source Illumos operating system is the only open-sourced Unix operating system which was derived from the now discontinued Open Solaris project.</p>
