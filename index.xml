      <description>Hello my name is Safi ud Din Khan. I am from Lahore, Pakistan. I am mainly an Electrical Engineer by education but also a developer and have wide variety of other interests including history. I am also an advocate of free and open source software and a committed Linux user since 2013 but will also tolerate proprietary software if necessary. Though I am using Linux as my main OS since 2013 but I have been exposed to Linux, BSDs and some flavors of Unix since childhood and teenage years back in the late 90s and early 2000s though It was mainly as a curiosity back then and I did not knew much and did not take Linux seriously until 2013.</description>
