<h1>About</h1>
<p><img src="/me.jpg" alt="My Picture" title="My Picture"></p>
<p>Hello my name is Safi ud Din Khan. I am from Lahore, Pakistan. I am mainly an Electrical Engineer by education but also a developer and have wide variety of other interests including history. I am also an advocate of free and open source software and a committed Linux user since 2013 but will also tolerate proprietary software if necessary. Though I am using Linux as my main OS since 2013 but I have been exposed to Linux, BSDs and some flavors of Unix since childhood and teenage years back in the late 90s and early 2000s though It was mainly as a curiosity back then and I did not knew much and did not take Linux seriously until 2013. I am also interested in other Unix-like operating systems like the BSDs and alternate obscure and historic operating systems and computers. I also love the modern single board computers and own 3 Raspberry Pis which are a Raspberry Pi 1, Raspberry Pi Zero W and Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB model). My blog will mostly concentrate on technology mainly free and open-source software and retro computing and gaming (mainly via emulators as I don&rsquo;t have my old computers anymore) but I may occasionally write on other topics as well. I ain’t gonna concentrate on the latest and the greatest hardware but mostly on budget computing and gaming. I hope you will enjoy my blog.</p>
<p>Finally feel free to contact me my email address is <a href="mailto:safiuddinkhan@gmail.com">safiuddinkhan@gmail.com</a></p>
